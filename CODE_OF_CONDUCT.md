# MyQuran Project Code of Conduct

The purpose of the MyQuran project is to invite our Muslim brothers and sisters into the sacred world of the Qur'an and to encourage participation in a global Qur'an recitation campaign. To achieve this purpose respectfully, we have outlined some essential guidelines for everyone involved.

## Be Respectful
We expect all contributors to approach each other with respect. Everyone’s ideas and suggestions are valued, and we ask that all participants maintain a respectful and constructive attitude, especially when differing views arise.

## Inclusivity
MyQuran is open to participation from everyone, regardless of nationality, location, gender, or social status. It’s important to us that everyone feels welcome and valued in our community.

## Provide Constructive Feedback
Offer constructive feedback on contributions to the project. Share your suggestions in a clear and respectful way. When pointing out issues or areas for improvement, strive to offer solutions if possible.

## Avoid Hostility
Discriminatory or hostile language or behavior based on race, religion, gender, age, or other personal attributes is strictly prohibited. We aim to create an environment where everyone feels valued and welcome.

## Be Supportive
Help and support each other. Guiding those in need contributes to the strength and health of our community.

## Security
For reporting security concerns or vulnerabilities, please reach out directly to the project administrators. Any reported security issues will be handled confidentially and kept private until resolved.

These standards apply to everyone who considers contributing to this project. As a community, we aim to uphold the principle of holding fast to the rope of Allah (Surah Al-Imran, 103) while developing this project in a respectful and purposeful manner.

In case of any violations of these guidelines, the project team will take appropriate action to maintain a positive environment. These guidelines exist to support a healthy, constructive contribution environment for everyone.

Thank you, and welcome!
